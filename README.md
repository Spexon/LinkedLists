# LinkedLists

This project follows guidelines posted from Data Structures and Algorithms, in which I 
will be creating multiple data structures such as a doubly linked lists using integers and pointers, 
binary search trees, and AVL trees in C++. I will continue build this project throughout the semester 
as I learn more about the course material.
